## About Me ##
I have been engaged in WEB development recently, but there are some successfully implemented ideas. I am currently working on a project that resembles a smart home. Data from various sensors are sent to the server, where they are processed, and based on the received result, control signals are formed, which are transmitted to the executing devices. The server is written in Laravel.

Counting Duplicates

    const text = 'abacdbeddddgggghhha'

    function duplicateCount(text){
      const txtLvrCs = text.toLowerCase()
      let k = []
      let n=0
     for (let i = 0; i < txtLvrCs.length; i++) {
        if (txtLvrCs.includes(txtLvrCs[i], i+1)===true && k.indexOf(txtLvrCs[i])===-1){
          
          k.push(txtLvrCs[i])
          n++
      }
     }
      return n
